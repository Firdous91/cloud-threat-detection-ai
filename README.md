## 🧠 Agentic System Design (LLM-style Thinking)

Inspired by agentic AI flows, this project performs:
1. **Detection** → via GuardDuty alerts  
2. **Decision** → Lambda-based rule logic  
3. **Action** → SNS notifications, and log storage  
4. **Display** → React dashboard hosted on AWS S3

This design mimics how intelligent LLM agents work in closed feedback loops.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- AWS Lambda (Python)
- GuardDuty, SNS
- S3 for static hosting
- DynamoDB for log storage
- ReactJS frontend dashboard


## ⚠️ Note
This project was deployed using an AWS Free Tier account, which is now closed.  
The full implementation, flow logic, and architecture are **preserved and documented** in the report above.
